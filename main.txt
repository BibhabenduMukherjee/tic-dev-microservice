small ticketing app that has
1. auth as a service
2. tickets as a service
3. orders 
4. expiration 
5. payments

{event - driven arc} nodejs+ts+kubernets [micro services arc]

different evenets ---> in this app 
1. UserCreated 
2. OrderCreated 
3. TicketCreated
4. ChargeCreated
5. OrderExpired
6. OrderCancelled
7. TicketUpdated
8. UserUpdated 


[++] STEP 1 -------
build auth as  a service along with the kubernetes and docker setup

build the docker image 
"docker build -t dockerid/auth ."
Then we create deployment for managaing pods


[+] Disclaimer 
After building the deployment object in kubernetes if want to change the codeBase it is very tedious task to do  means stpes are 
--> update codeBase
--> re-build the image 
---> pish it to docker hub   
--> run "kubectl rollout restart deployment <depl name>

SO WE USE A SPECIAL TOOLS CALLED skaffold
we have skaffold configured in the app 

[++++]
Now for load balancer service we use ingrees/ngnix
--> we apply a config for ingrees/ngnix
--> make a config file (ingress-srv.yaml)

ingrees/ngnix -- this will help to redirect trafic to the actual services that running to the cluster

In ingrees/ngnix config file we have an attributes called rules -> this will tell the information about how trafic goes in which backends

Now we create a cluster is Google Cloud
